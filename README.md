### Bugs

#### Unsolved bugs
- None.


#### Solved bugs 
 - styling bug : an incorrect settings of rules button lead to expand the html file , then it was resolved by removing the z-index and minus values.
 - The games rules button was not correctly or nicely aligned with the other share and play again buttons due to the span that is connected to it. so I solved it by moving its divs and position to the top of the page so the user also reads the rules before playing.
